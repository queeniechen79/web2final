                    Led by the members of the AAU (Asian Americans Unite), the lion dance is a traditional Chinese performance in which “lions” perform on the streets and go to houses asking for permission to perform for them. If the host consents, the "lion" will come in and start dancing as a blessing of luck and fortune for the home.
