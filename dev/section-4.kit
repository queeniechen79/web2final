                    Duck is the second most common food after mooncakes in the Mid-Autumn Festival. Chinese people believe that eating duck in autumn can expel pathogenic heat from their body to keep the balance between yin and yang, thus to enhance health.

                    Hairy Crab is a Shanghai specialty that is often eaten for Mid Autumn Festival because these crabs are “in season” in September and October. Around this time of the year, the crabs are getting ready to lay their eggs, which makes them the tastiest according to Chinese people. They are highly abundant in amino acids and protein.
